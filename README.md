# IEFPCourseProjects
All the projects that have been lectured in the IEFP Programming Technician Course

As mentioned in this repository I've placed most of the exercises that I deem relevant to showcase, of what I have learned and skills I've developed upon partaking in this programming course.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////         CODING       ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

For most of the languages we learned about variable declaration, initialization, functions, vector and array creation and manipulation, string manipulation, struct creation, classes and objects (when possible in
the language).

The languages that were lectured were:

-C
-C++
-C#(both console based and ASP.NET, with connections done to the a database via hardcoding, wizards and Entity Framework through the scaffolding method through classes)

-Visual Basic(Windows Forms based creation, we made a pseudo store app connected to a database managed through phpMyAdmin)

-SQL(Setting up a database, query usage, foreign key constraints, view creation, procedures and triggers)

-Python(on-going, currently explored various popular libraries, such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot for mathematical functions, data treatment and graphical representation of data respectively)

-Java(on-going)

-HTML (a markup language more than a proper coding one, but we learned the basics of webpage set up through it, as well as stylization through CSS stylesheets)


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////          NETWORK         ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

There were also lectures in relation to network setups and how they work:

-IP ranges and assignments, how its calculated and network masks.
-CISCO Networking Devices and Initial Configuration course completion (Discussing various topics such as IP address structures, address resolutions, various layers of the osi model(emphasis on transport and network layers))
-Learning commands and structures through the usage of various CISCO Packet Tracer exercises.
-We also configured our own peer-to-peer network as well as a server-client network using Windows Server 2019 (first testing it in a virtual machine through Oracle and then using physical computers, 1 server and 3 client machines)
